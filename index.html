            My name is <strong class="text--purple">Nickhil Naiker</strong> and I am currently in the final year of my academic journey at the University of Technology Sydney, pursuing a Bachelor of Mechatronics Engineering (Honours), and Bachelor of Creative Intelligence and Innovation. I believe I am someone who always aims to be hardworking, willing to learn and enjoys working in teams. 
          </p>
          <p class="about-me__info--para">
            My passion mainly involves doing research and development in robotics and emerging technologies designed for everyday consumers. This interest stems from exploring the creative side of engineering, such as being able to recognise a problem and innovate in that field with technology. My career aspirations are to be a part of projects that utilise technology to improve the lives of consumers and one day have a project of my own be implemented in the real world. 
          </p>
          <p class="about-me__info--para">
            I have worked on projects in university that I would enjoy re-visiting such as LIDAR and image recognition to execute a goal. I am also currently working on a capstone project that aims to innovate in the retail space using RFID tags. Additionally, I was involved in the research and development team at my internship in areas such as hydrogen fuel cell technology, computer vision and LIDAR technology for exploring real-world applications.
