              During my internship I attended many site visits for ASP Level 3 Design to better understand the project location and data collection. In particular, one project involved visiting two sites that were two hours away. Initially, I was excited to attend these site visits as it would be good exposure to the real-world and getting familiar with the raw data collected and how it is then interpreted for design. However, the travel time was a bit frustrating when considering that some site visits like the one mentioned only required about 30 minutes of working, most of which were taking photos and measurements of distribution poles, pillars and notifying the nearby neighbors of the project commencing. Despite enjoying the experiences of working on-site, I could not help but feel that this was a very inefficient process as we had spent half a day traveling to and from site just for some basic data collection, however I was worried to express this to my colleagues as I was just an intern. I believe I am someone who when given a task, will always seek to accomplish it in the most efficient way. Hence, after the site visit I built up the courage to present my idea of outsourcing site data that needed to be collected via Lidar drone surveying. This was a far sustainable practice as it saved us the manual labour and time traveling to sites. As Melgarejo (2022) states “sustainable engineering as the practice of designing processes that drive material and energy efficiencies to minimize their environmental impact”. Not only did this allow us to take more jobs as we could obtain site data remotely, but it also minimised our carbon footprint as the surveying company we were working with already had a database of existing Lidar data for various sites. I believe next time I will be more confident when presenting an idea despite my colleagues having far more experience, as I learnt the values of taking on a leadership role and how it can benefit a company. I also realised the importance of thinking outside the box in areas such as sustainable practices in engineering, as they are beneficial to both the company and environment.

              During my internship I was given the responsibility of managing the logistics for Sydney as we would occasionally receive hardware that needed to be delivered to a client within Australia or overseas. This meant having to communicate with team members who were situated overseas and responsible for sending hardware to my office. There was one occasion where I was made incharge of receiving a product that had to be sent to a client in the next few days. However, there was an email miscommunication between an overseas colleague and I, on the papers that had to be sent with the product. This resulted in the product being held up at the shipment site and delayed for a few days. I felt pretty stressed and frustrated as I did not have the experience to know how to resolve this issue and did not want to cost the company a client. I do believe we were both at fault as I was not certain about the instruction and went ahead while the instruction given to me was poorly written. Although it did not cause too much of an issue in the past, this was a common occurrence as the overseas team were not fluent in English, often resulting in spelling and grammatical errors. I believe I am someone who tries to overcome challenges by adapting, which is exactly what I planned on doing after this incident. The Middlebury Language Schools (2023) explores the importance of intercultural communication as people are now more connected than ever due to advancements in transportation, global media and the world wide web. Where, interacting effectively across cultural lines requires perseverance and sensitivity to one another's differences. Hence, to overcome this challenge we agreed to communicate more regularly over video calls as opposed to emails, allowing more transparency and understanding of each other's instruction. In the end, we managed to form a more connected relationship that eliminated uncertainties which I would previously face. The experience was definitely insightful as it improved my interpersonal skills such as communication while being more sympathetic and understanding to team members.
